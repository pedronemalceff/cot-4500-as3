# COP4500 Numerical Calculus Assignment 3 
This application was built with `Python` using the `NumPy` library. 
## Purpose 
This repository is here to demonstrate the numerical methods needed to
solve differential equations, and to explain how solution accuracy can be controlled and how
stability can be ensured by selecting the appropriate methods. 
## Requirements Project was made in a development environment using
`Python 3.9` 

## Usage 
To execute the program, open the cloned repo directory in your terminal and navigate to `.\src\main` 
Run
``` python assignment_3.py ``` 
Or run from the project root directory using
``` python src\main\assignment_3.py ```
