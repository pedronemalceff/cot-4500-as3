# COP4500 Numerical Calculus Assignment 3 
This application was built with `Python` using the `NumPy` library. 
## Purpose 
This repository is here to demonstrate an understanding of interpolation and approximation of polynomials using various numerical methods. The algorithms used to solve the problems in this assignment include Neville's method, Newton's forward method, divided difference, Hermite polynomial approximation, and cubic spline interpolation. 
## Requirements Project was made in a development environment using
`Python 3.9` 

## Usage 
To execute the program, open the cloned repo directory in your terminal and navigate to `.\src\main` 
Run
``` python assignment_3.py ``` 
Or run from the project root directory using
``` python src\main\assignment_3.py ```
